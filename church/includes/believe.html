            <h4>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h4>
        </section>
        <section class="word-section">
            <h4>God</h4>
            <p>We believe in one God who existts in three persons, God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. He is an infinite, all knowing and Powerful God.</p>
            <p>(Gen 1:26-27, Duet 6:4, Philip 2:6, Acts 5:3-4.)</p>

            <h4>Jesus</h4>
            <p>We believe Jesus is the Son of God, who embodies the fullness of God for eternity. He came to live among us a sinless life and became a sacrifice for our sins. In putting our trust in the work of salvation He accomplished on the cross and we received eternal life with God. We believe trusting in Jesus as our redeemer is the only way to eternal fellowship with God and not good works of ours.</p>
            <p>(Matt 1:23, Jon 1:1-3, Jn 3:16, Philip 2(6-11), Col 2:9, 1.Cor 1:18, Eph 2:8.)</p>

            <h4>The Bible</h4>
            <p>It is the inerrant, infallible Word of God. We believe the Bible is the foundation to our faith and way of life.</p>
            <p>(2 Tim 3:16,17)</p>

            <h4>Church</h4>
            <p>We believe the Church is not a building. The Church is the body of Christ for which He died on the cross. The Church is a collection of believers empowered by Godâ€™s word and his spirit to do the good work of expanding the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>(1 Cor 12:27, Eph 4:12)</p>
