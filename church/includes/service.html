            <h3>Our Service</h3>
            <h5>Sundays at Oryema Church <br><span>10:00AM - 1:00PM</span></h5>
            <p>Every Sunday we start with an electrifying worship experience including songs that exalt our God and our passionate love for Him. It is followded by empowering and scripyure-based teaching that will remind us what Jesus did for us and equip us to live a life that please Him. Expect to feel Welcome and greeted by others.</p>

            <h5>Children's Church <br><span>(Parallel with the service time)</span></h5>

            <p class="verse">Let the little children come to me.- Jesus (Matt 19:14)</p>
            <p>We are committed to lead little children to Jesus. We belive children are created to have a relationship with God. They are filled with unique giftings and a purpose in life. Through biblical spiritual disciplines designed to engage them, we aim to raise children who love God, are apart of church community, and are Godly influencers in their generation all the days of their lives. There will be an energetic worship experience and interactive teachings designed to grow children in their relationship with God.</p>
